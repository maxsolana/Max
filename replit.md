# $MAX Token Presale - Static Deployment Guide

## Overview

This is a cryptocurrency token presale landing page for "$MAX Token" - a Christmas-themed community coin on the Solana blockchain. The application is a static web app designed for deployment on GitHub Pages. It features Solana Pay integration for purchasing tokens and is entirely frontend-driven with no backend requirements.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

To deploy this project to GitHub Pages:
1. Ensure the `dist` directory is generated by running `npm run build`.
2. Push the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch or configure GitHub to deploy from the `main` branch root (if you move `dist` contents there).
3. The project includes a `404.html` and a script in `index.html` to handle Single Page Application (SPA) routing on GitHub Pages.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with path aliases
- **Static Hosting**: Configured with `base: "./"` for relative path support.
- **SPA Routing**: Uses the `spa-github-pages` approach with a custom `404.html` to redirect deep links back to the main index.

### Static Assets
- Logos and icons are located in the `public/` directory for reliable static serving.
- Solana Pay links (`solana:`) handle payments without a backend.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Client-focused repository with path aliases for clean imports.
   - Simplified for static deployment.

2. **GitHub Pages Routing**: Uses a script in `index.html` and a custom `404.html` to handle SPA routing.
   - Essential for deep-linking support on static hosts.

3. **Event Tracking**: Non-blocking analytics disabled for static deployment to ensure no backend dependencies.
